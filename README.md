## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your
project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height
screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to
crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot.
FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file
path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to
add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project was quite basic and kind of a training with using API and React - together with
useState, useEffect and useContext hooks.

### Continued development

Would like to attach the IP WebApi without 1000 one time limit.
